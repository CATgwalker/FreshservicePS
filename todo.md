- [ ] New-FreshServiceAgentRoleConfig - need a way when assignment scope is specified_groups, make the groups parameter mandatory.Is there any way to get the plan since some options are for certain plans?
- [ ] Get-FSAgent - Add quick filters for Email and others
- [ ] Get-FSAsset - Parameterset for Listing Components, Requests, Contracts.  Need to use display_id versus id like rest of the api? Filter does not support pagination??
- [ ] Get-FSForm  - Move this functionality to the Get functions?  Get-FSRequester -Form
- [ ] Remove-FSSoftware - Bulk support.  Would need to loop through array to generate array to make call.  Does it save API calls?
- [ ] New-FSSoftwareUser - Bulk support.  Not sure you gain much and it would be difficult to enforce a schema without a supplemental helper cmdlet (e.g. New-FSSoftwareUserItem)
- [ ] Remove-FSSoftwareUser - Call not working. Once this is working can do support for devices.
- [ ] SoftwareDevice cmdlets - resolve Remove-FSSoftwareUser issue.
- [ ] Get-FSSoftware - add switch for list software relationships
- [ ] Get-FSContract -Parameterset doesn't let you do the by Id and then assoc_assets OR attachments.  Right now it would let you pass both, but only process one, which isn't ideal.  Possibly add a Details (or Extended) param with validateset and then pass right params or break out into seperate functions e.g. Get-FSContractAttachment
- [ ] New-FSContract - add supplemental script for generation of item cost objects.
- [ ] Set-FSContract - Parameterset for Approve\Reject.
- [ ] Set-FSProject - no return for Archive\Restore
- [ ] Get-FSSolutionFolder - No GET for All, only by Category??
- [ ] Set-FSSolutionArticle - Requiring State in payload, not in documentation.
- [ ] Get-FSOnboardingRequest - need to create requests to test.  {"code":"inaccessible_api","message":"There are no active actors available."}
- [ ] Get-FSTask - need to move to the GET for type or have param for type as mandatory.
- [ ] Attachment Support - Easiest approach is to just set #requires to 7.x and use the -Form on Invoke RestMethod or WebRequest.
